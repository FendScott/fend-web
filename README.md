# Fend

The focal point of Fend is a site where users can purchase rainforest in half acre blocks. Until now, the experience of online donation has been one which is typically carried out in isolation, ends abruptly and has little or no feedback. Fend aims to transform this experience into a compelling journey that starts with the user’s donation rather than ending with it.

## How it will work

To do thiswe introduce interactivity to the site enabling users to zoom in and select one pixel of the front page for every 0.5 acre of rainforest that they purchase at $60. As people donate the front page will be increasingly populated by green dots.

In its first instance this novelty gives donors incentive to return to Fend and follow progress on social media. Providing donors with images and GIFs of their block/s (formatted for social platforms) will further encourage engagement and referrals.

In the grander scheme, Fend’s front page becomes a narrative of its own, and a very effective device to communicate and promote our cause. The concept is designed for proliferation on social
media given that a single image of Fend’s front page can be replicated at will to communicate
the success of the charity in a very direct and intuitive way. It requires no words, facts or figures to understand - the more green, the greater the success. Fend’s evolving front page may become recognised as a powerful story unfolding in a single image.
